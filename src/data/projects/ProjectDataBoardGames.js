          "-Battlesuit- (name TBD) is a my first full effort to design and implement a board game. I created the first draft of the rules back in late 2014 and have built on those rules on-and-off over the past several years. The game is inspired by both tabletop wargaming and tournament fighter video games. I loved the idea of player-customizable move sets, and the fiddly rules that come with tabletop wargaming. I wanted to capture the feeling of commanding a powerful armored suit, but also not have the game take hours to play.",
          "Currently on its 30th revision, the game has come a long way from those early days. I've learned much about how gameplay is taught, and how people react to a new game. "
