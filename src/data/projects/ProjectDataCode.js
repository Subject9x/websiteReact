They are tasked with completing mssions like patrols, base defense, and interceptions of enemy forces. The player may customize their 'Metal with weapons and equipment they've unlocked through gameplay.",

The board game and music sections remained 'coming soon' for about 5 years now - I don't they're coming. Looking to rebuild my website and give the layout a facelift, I setteld on trying ReactJS. Front-end web work isn't my strongest suit, but I enjoy hobby-level programming just as much as my work.",

The speed with which you can lay items out on a page with React was also very nice, I could adjust my page layouts for my website almost in real time, wih a minimum of shifting code/functionality.",
