I've created helpful documents and a design bible that can be found on the github wiki of the project."

Basically the calculator turns the big list of modifiers into UI buttons and checkboxes, removing the need to actually calculate anything. Players simply input the conditions of the attack to be made, and the system prints out the number that the player needs to roll. It also colors this number based on odds, a lower probabilty of success will be red and vice versa.",
