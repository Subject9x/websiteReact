            in almost any genre. Reinterpreting the look and feel of mecha from various properties is also something I've done as well. Several mecha franchises at this point are 
            quite old, and giving an updated look is both an interesting challenge for me the artist, as well as a chance to allow some neat older designs to really shine
            in a more contemporary style.</Col>
